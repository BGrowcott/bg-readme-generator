## Usage

A small form allows a user to search for a city.

When a user search for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. The city is also added to the search history.

The webpage presents the user with the city name, the local date and time, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index.

The UV index is colour coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe.

The 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

When the user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with the current and future conditions for that city.

If a user search is invalid they are presented with a modal explaining their error.

Bad searches and repeated searches are not added the search history or local storage.

A day or night theme is applied to the page according to the local time of the searched city.
